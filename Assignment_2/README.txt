Started Sept 21. Ended Sept 29.
Time taken: way too long. ~25 hours.

Spent time with every UTA from Monday - Sunday in the link.

Felt like this was the equivalent of 4 classes work wise. 

Love the material, but not processing enough of it because it's moving so fast. 

Really wish we had more time on hoopsstats.s/more guidance on dynamic memory allocation.

Be gentle.
